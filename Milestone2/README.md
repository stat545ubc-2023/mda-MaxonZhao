# Repository Orientation:

This repository contains the first deliverable for a Mini Data-Analysis project. The analysis focuses on the `vancouver_trees` 
dataset, exploring various facets of tree data in Vancouver, such as species distribution, planting patterns, and relationships with urban infrastructure.

## Engaging with the Repository
To engage with the repository, you should be familiar with the tools and packages introduced 
in STAT 545A. Here's how you can explore the project:

### Data Analysis File: 
Start with the Mini-Data-Analysis-Deliverable-1.Rmd file. 
This R markdown file contains the entire analysis process, 
from dataset exploration to forming research questions. 
The corresponding knitted .md file provides a readable report with outputs, plots, and commentary.

### Required Packages: 
Before running the Rmd file, ensure you have the datateachr, dplyr, and ggplot2 packages installed.
Instructions for installation are provided within the Rmd file.
